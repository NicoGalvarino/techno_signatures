# technosignatures

This is where I publish my source code and notebooks for my open research projects on [technosignatures](https://open-research.gemmadanks.com/notes/technosignatures/). 

You can read more about my open research on [my open research site](https://open-research.gemmadanks.com/).

## Projects

### [Radio SETI](radio-seti/)
The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) by looking for intentional messages encoded in radio waves.

#### [Interstellar communications](radio-seti/interstellar-communications)
This notebook and associated Python code is my exploration of the classic 1959 paper by Cocconi & Morrison that began the era of radio SETI.
